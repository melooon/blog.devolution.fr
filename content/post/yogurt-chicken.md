## Ingredients

- **1 package Container plain low-fat yogurt**
- **626 g Skinless, boneless chicken breasts**
- 1 . Lemon, juiced
- 2.00 cup Bread crumbs, seasoned
- 1 teaspoon Garlic powder
- 2 tablespoon Butter
- 2 teaspoon Chopped fresh parsley

## Preparations

Preheat oven to 170 degrees C (350 degrees F). Place yogurt in a small bowl and stir until creamy smooth. Add lemon and stir together. (Note: If you do not stir the yogurt first, the lemon juice will make the yogurt curdle.) In a separate shallow dish or bowl combine the bread crumbs, garlic powder and salt to taste; mix together. In a baking dish place 1 scant pat of butter or margarine for each chicken breast. Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. Dip each breast in the lemon/yogurt mixture, then in the bread crumb mixture (coating completely but not heavily). Place coated chicken in the baking dish and top each breast with a full pat of butter or margarine. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Let cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
