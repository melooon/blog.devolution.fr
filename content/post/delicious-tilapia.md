A summer breakfast recipe, fresh and tasty
<!--more-->

## Ingredients

- **678 g Tilapia fillets**
- 1 . Egg
- 2 tablespoon Soy sauce
- 2 tablespoon All-purpose flour
- 1.15 cup Seasoned bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoon Vegetable oil

## Preparations

Beat the egg and soy sauce together in a bowl. Gently press the tilapia pieces into the flour to coat; shake off the excess flour. Dip each flour-coated piece into the beaten egg mixture and then press into bread crumbs. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded tilapia onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the breaded tilapia in the vegetable oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.  

`The given recipe is for lunch and dinner so that you don't have to cook twice. Consume the bigger part of the meal at lunch and leave the remainder for dinner.`
