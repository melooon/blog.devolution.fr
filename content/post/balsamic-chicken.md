## Ingredients

- **5 tablespoon Balsamic vinegar**
- **626 g Skinless, boneless chicken breast halves**

- 2 tablespoon Olive oil
- 2/3 . Onion, thinly sliced
- 2/3 can Diced tomatoes

## Preparations

Season both sides of chicken breasts with garlic salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook seasoned chicken breasts until chicken is browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add onion; cook and stir until onion is browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour diced tomatoes and balsamic vinegar over chicken; season with basil, oregano, rosemary and thyme. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 70 degrees C (170 degrees F).
