<!--more-->

## Ingredients

- **417 g Sirloin steak, cubed**
- 5 tablespoon Soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon Vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon Lemon juice
- 2 teaspoon Sesame seeds
- 2 teaspoon White sugar
- 1 . Green onion, thinly sliced
- 1/2 . Clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon Ground ginger

## Preparations

In a glass or plastic bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, oil, lemon juice, sesame seeds, sugar, green onions, garlic, and ginger. Thread the meat onto skewers. (If you are using wooden skewers, soak them 30 minutes first.) Place the skewers in a plastic or glass container just large enough to hold them, and pour the marinade over the meat, turning to coat well. Cover, and chill for a minimum of 4 hours. Preheat grill for high heat, and position grate. Brush grate with oil, and place skewers on grill. Grill for 10 to 15 minutes, occasionally turning kabobs to ensure even cooking.  

`The given recipe is for lunch and dinner so that you don't have to cook twice. Consume the bigger part of the meal at lunch and leave the remainder for dinner.`
