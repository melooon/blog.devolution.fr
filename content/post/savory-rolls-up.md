A summer breakfast recipe, fresh and tasty
<!--more-->

## Ingredients

- **626 g Skinless, boneless chicken breasts**
- 5 . Thick slices cheese
- 1 . Egg, beaten
- 1.15 cup Dried bread crumbs
- 3 tablespoon Chopped fresh parsley
- 1 . Clove garlic, chopped
- 2 tablespoon Olive oil
- 1.15 can Chicken broth

## Preparations

Preheat oven to 190 degrees C (370 degrees F). Pound the chicken breast. In a shallow plate or bowl, mix together the bread crumbs and parsley. Place a slice of cheese on each breast, roll up tightly, then dip into the egg and then the bread crumb mixture. (Note: Hold roll closed; after dipping, you will see that it begins to stay together). In a large skillet, saute garlic in olive oil. Add roll ups and brown quickly, just enough for the chicken to have a crisp outer coating. Remove roll ups from skillet and drain on paper towels. Pour 1/2 of the chicken broth into baking dish. Add all four roll ups. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, basting once with the remaining broth.  

`The given recipe is for lunch and dinner so that you don't have to cook twice. Consume the bigger part of the meal at lunch and leave the remainder for dinner.`
