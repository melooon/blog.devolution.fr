A summer breakfast recipe, fresh and tasty
<!--more-->

## Ingredients

- **730 g Fillets cod**
- 1 tablespoon Sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon Chili sauce
- 5 . Slices bacon
- 1/2 . Leek, chopped
- 17 g Enoki mushrooms

## Preparations

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Soak some toothpicks in water while the grill heats up. Spread a thin layer of sesame oil and chili sauce onto one side of each fish fillet. At one end, place some of the leek and a couple of mushrooms. Roll towards the other end. Wrap each roll with a slice of bacon, and secure with two toothpicks. Place on the preheated grill, and cook covered for 5 minutes. Be careful of flare-ups from the bacon grease. Turn over, and cook for 5 more minutes, until bacon is crisp and fish flakes easily.
