## Ingredients

- **417 g Beef tenderloin roast**
- 2 tablespoon Soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon Melted butter

## Preparations

Preheat oven to 175 degrees C (350 degrees F ). Place roast into a shallow, glass baking dish. Pour soy sauce and melted butter over the tenderloin. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes, then turn the roast over, and continue cooking 35 to 40 minutes, basting occasionally until the internal temperature of the roast is at 60 degrees C (140 degrees F) for medium. Or, cook to your desired degree of doneness. Let meat rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.  

`The given recipe is for lunch and dinner so that you don't have to cook twice. Consume the bigger part of the meal at lunch and leave the remainder for dinner.`
