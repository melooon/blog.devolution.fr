<!--more-->

## Ingredients

- **1.00 cup Rolled oats**
- 2 tablespoon Shredded coconut
- 2 tablespoon Honey
- 1 tablespoon Creamy peanut butter
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon Salt

## Preparations

Preheat oven to 160 degrees C (320 degrees F). Grease a square baking dish. Spread the oats and coconut evenly across a baking sheet. Toast oats and coconut in preheated oven until browned, about 10 minutes; transfer to a large mixing bowl. Mix honey, peanut butter, vanilla extract, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until smooth. Pour the honey mixture over the oats and coconut; stir to coat. Spread the mixture evenly into the prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until beginning to dry, about 15 minutes for crunchy granola bars, less if you like them chewy. Cool completely before cutting.  Cook 2 portions and you will have your breakfast ready for 2 days of your personal meal plan.
